== Accessing the CXF JAXRS endpoint

When the example is running, a CXF JAXRS endpoint is available.

If you run the example on a single-node OpenShift cluster, then the REST service is exposed at 'http://spring-boot-camel-jaxws-xml-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io/service`.

Notice: As it depends on your OpenShift setup, the hostname (route) might vary. Verify with `oc get routes` which hostname is valid for you.

- <http://spring-boot-camel-jaxws-xml-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io/service/hello?wsdl>
will now display the generated WSDL.
